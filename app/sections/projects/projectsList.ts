      "A one-page application created for a real customer. The site is fully responsive and includes 4 sections: main, about us, services and contact. Contact form handling done with react-hook-form, validation - zod. Mail handling - emailJS. Animation using motion. Accordion components and reusable service cards displayed dynamically. The most difficult task for me was to design the application according to the client's guidelines, in order to do this I had to learn Figma, which I didn't know before. This project demonstrates my skills: building responsive web applications using React and Typescript, creating animations, styling using Tailwind, semantics, creating components, knowing JSX, dynamically displaying information, working with forms and working with customers.

    description:
      "Single page app created for a real customer. I made the site over a year ago when I started learning javascript. The application is fully responsive and contains a lot of reactive components, such as an accordion, a sliding graphic (table) on small screens, buttons, links, a map with the location, cards of instructors after clicking which a modal with more information appears. I am most satisfied with the dynamic price list which, after clicking on a category button, displays a list of classes and their price, as this was a challenge for me at the time. In addition, the site includes a contact form, validation using regular expressions in javascript, the emailJS library is responsible for the sending process. For styling and animation I used SCSS. After sending a message from the form, a confirmation modal appears.",
